                            Bio-medical Waste Management Rules, 2016 notified on 28.03.2016 and as amended thereof under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, stipulates that it is the duty of every Health Care Facility (HCF) to establish a bar code system for bags or containers containing bio-medical waste (BMW) to be sent out of the premises or place for any purpose, by 27.03.2019. Also, Rule 5 of the BMWM Rules, 2016 stipulates that it is the duty of the every Operator of Common Bio-medical Waste Treatment Facility (CBWTF) to establish bar code system for handling of bio-medical waste. </p>

                            These guidelines have been prepared to facilitate and provide guidance to both the Occupier as well as Operator of CBWTF to establish bar code system and also to have uniformity in adoption of the bar code system throughout the country, thereby ensuring effective enforcement of the BMWM Rules, 2016. </p>

                            The barcode system is used for tracking bio medical waste generated from health care facilities to its ultimate disposal. Material tracking can be easily managed through bar coding.  Health care facility generates barcodes for bags or containers containing biomedical waste. If HCFs having less than 30 no. of beds are not required to scan their bags containing bio-medical waste. Truck driver  scans the hospital barcode and records the waste collection in app and send the details to HCF via email. Waste acceptance receipt comprising of date, time, no. of bags, total weight of colour coded bags/containers will be sent to the health care facilities by the CBWTF via email.  Whereas, Health Care Facilities having 30 or more no. of beds shall have to generate bar codes for all the bags containing bio-medical waste. The waste collected  by the truck driver will be sent to the plant. At  the plant each bag will be scanned and generates waste acceptance receipt. This acceptance report will be printed and sent to HCF via email also. Daily and monthly waste collection reports can be tracked.
