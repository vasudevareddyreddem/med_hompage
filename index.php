                        <p>
                            As per Bio-medical Waste Management Rules, 2016 notified on 28.03.2016 and as amended thereof under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, stipulates that it is the duty of every Health Care Facility (HCF) to establish a bar code system for bags or containers containing bio-medical waste (BMW) to be sent out of the premises or place for any purpose, by 27.03.2019. Also, Rule 5 of the BMWM Rules, 2016 stipulates that it is the duty of the every Operator of Common Bio-medical Waste Treatment Facility (CBWTF) to establish bar code system for handling of bio-medical waste. </p>
                        <p>
                            As per these guidelines Medspace has developed a waste management software to track the disposal activity from accumulation of waste to disposal of waste.
